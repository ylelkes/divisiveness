Forgive me for opening with a bit of an abrasive example, but i am hard pressed to find someone who more perfectly captures what i mean by divisive content than tucker carlson. \[show video\] he is someone who's modus operandi is to capture the attention of his audience by pitting them against some other group.

`He is going to double down on the white nationalism because the minute-by-minutes show that the audience eats it up," said another former Fox employee, who worked frequently with Mr. Carlson.`

::: notes
roughly 2 years ago, the nytimes ran this expose about the evolution –or devolution– of tucker carlson. most of the article was about how he has become a far right demagogue, heavily focused on instilling fear in his viewers by talking about threats posed by black americans, democrats, immigrants, feminists and, generally pushing this group-based us versus them mentality.

that tucker carlson engages in identity baiting is probably not that surprising to anyone that has been somewhat attune to politics over the past 10-20 years. what i found most interesting, however, was that his coverage seemed less related to his own ideology than it was at maximizing ratings. \[click\] The article discusses his use of newly available minute-by-minute ratings to titrate his racism to maximize ratings.

This story captured a few component of what i want to talk about today

1\) the information environment feels pretty nasty, and we, the consumers, are at least partly to blame

## ![Rozado et al (2022)](images/clipboard-3247471226.png)

::: notes
there is now a fair deal of evidence that things are getting nastier. this is a figure from a paper by Rozado et al (2022) that shows the sentiment of headlines in lots of different newspapers over time. you see a 314% decrase in positivty between 2000 and 2019. it's not totally clear to me if this is a meaningful drop (how much more negative is -.1 than .1) but it is a large drop-nonetheless.

::: notes
here is another figure from a recent paper from frimer et al which uses a machine learning tool, PerspectiveAPI from google. to measure the toxicity of tweets over time and you see this uptick in what they call incivility among politicians. i assume that if you did this during the biden presidency you see that the numbers have dropped again

::: notes
finally, this is a figure from a new very good book by thomas Zeitzoff (2023) that shows the frequency of what he calls nasty politics in the New York Times over time. you see this peak around the civil war and then another peak around the 2016 election.

nasty politics is defined as the presence of key words like "(‘violent language, violent rhetoric, political insult, political smear, political duel, political brawl, OR political slander)" all these figures seem to be pointing to the same conclusion: the information environment is getting nastier.

::: notes
Americans are clearly not happy with the state of politics. Pew ran a survey last year where they asked respondents an open-ended question to describe politics today. This is a list of the most common words sized by frequency. Not surprisingly, most of them are bad. whether or not we would see a different wordcloud if we asked this question 10 years ago is an open question, but even the cross-section gives us some insight into how people feel about the state of politics.
:::

## ![See also Costa (2021), Zeitzoff (2023)](images/clipboard-1849326142.png)

::: notes
and people clearly don't like it. this is another graph from that pew survey which asked people what kind of information they would like to see. americans say, overwhelmingly that they would like more policy-oriented content and less content that is focused on the disgreements between republicans and democrats. this raises the question, why, in a media system that is clearly market-driven, are we bombarded with divisive content that we don't want to see.

## Overview of the talk

1.  Is the Information Environment More Divisive?
    -   Maybe, but past approaches fall short.
2.  Why Negativity?
    -   Politicians & media crave attention (perhaps more than ever).
    -   New tools help track attention.
    -   We're overwhelmed with content, and seek to consume useful and trustworthy information and signal trustworthiness
    -   Divisive content cuts through the noise.

::: notes
today i want to talk about a few things that i think are missing from the conversation about the information environment. first, i want to talk about the evidence that the information environment is getting nastier. although there is quite a bit of evidence that soething haas changed, i'm not totally sure what that this. second, i want to talk about why we see divisive information even if we claim to hate it. i think that there are a few reasons for this, but i think that the most important one is that policymakers, media outlets and information consumers are all responding to new features of the information environment that makes this type of information particularly compelling.

increasinglyt impersonal world where we interact with lots of people we don't know and we are trying to signal that we are trustworth

## Sentiment/ML approaches often give unreliable results

{{< include images/sentiment_null.html >}}

::: notes
my first point is the approaches that have document increased divisiveness rely on methods that don't always give very sensible results. here are four sentences that in my mind are neutral. the first two sentence are about support regulation of firearms. the only difference between them is that the first one includes the phrase black americans while the second sentence only includes americans. the 3rd and 4th sentences are similar but about the regulation of prescription drugs. i then fed them to two prominent ways that the literature has documented toxicity and negativity. the first is a machine learning tool called PerspectiveAPI that was used in that frimer paper the second is a sentiment analysis tool called Vader. the scores that are outputed for toxicity go from 0 to 1 and sentiment go from -1 to 1

![](images/Sentiment_Analysis_Methods_Performance.png)

::: notes

to show you that i'm not just cherry picking sentences this was a recent paper from van atteveldt et al that compared various approached to sentiment analysis including a dictionary approach like vader and various machine learning approaches and final a human coding approach. they tracked the accuracy, or amount of agreement there was between the data the authors handcoded and these other methods. the human coded metrics were the only ones that gave reliable results

:::

## Keywords may be measuring changes in coverage, not rhetoric

![(Zeitzoff, 2023) key words associated with nasty politics: “united states AND congress AND (‘violent language, violent rhetoric, political insult, political smear, political duel, political brawl, OR political slander).](images/clipboard-2598538575.png)

::: notes
Keywords do not necessarily capture changes in rhetoric but changes in how outlets are covering politics
:::

## LLMs are a game changer for content analysis:

1.  We can now do the type content analyses that once required a team of RAs (and at a far greater scale and a fraction of the price)
2.  At the same (or better) level of accuracy
3.  And even ask the LLM to explain its decision (which is often more reasonable than our own)

::: notes
LLMs are a game changer for content analysis. We once had to assemble teams of undergraduates or rely on turkers to code content, and, of course, these people would get fatigued or biased, but now we can reach the same or sometimes better level of accuracy. and we can do it at a far greater scale. and we can even ask the LLM to explain its decision, which is often more reasonable than our own. when we first started one of the projects i'm going to be talking about today, we were working with amazon data science team with the goal of building a tool that could classify text in a way that was as good as a human coder. chatgpt came out at about that time. we would go back and forth with amazon and their team of expert annotators. by the end of the exercise they told us that it would be a waste of money to continue to pay them to annotate the data because the LLM was doing a better job.

llms do a bunch of stuff that we couldn't do before. they can better account for context, subjectivity, and ambiguity. for instance, here's a sentence i fed into vader "Oh, great, another tax cut for the rich" and it labeled it as positive. here's the output from chatgpt
:::

## Divisive content can be many things (not all of them bad!)

1.  Personal attacks: Question the character, integrity, intelligence, morality or patriotism of a person or a political party.

2.  Constructive debate: Objects to policy, legislation and other governmental decisions with negative words, but relies on facts and doesn't use emotional appeals or personal attacks.

3.  Identity-oriented content: Explictly references a group identity based on partisanship, religion, race, gender (Klein, 2020)

::: notes
Hard to see value in personal attacks

Policy attacks may provide substantive information about candidates and their policy positions, helping to hold politicians over style (Geer, 2006)

Identity content may activate identities and contribute to "us-versus-them" thinking (Klein, 2020), but it may reflect recognition of often marginalized groups

## Two projects that apply LLMs to large corpora of text

1.  The Polarization Research Lab Elite Rhetoric Tracker (with Sean Westwood and Matt Wetzel)
2.  The Rise and Demand for Identity-Oriented Media Coverage (with Dan Hopkins and Sam Wolken in AJPS)

## The Elite Rhetoric Tracker

1.  Ingested millions of statements from floor speeches, social media, newsletters, and press releases from members of congress from between 2022 and today.

2.  Carefully [engineered prompts](https://github.com/Polarization-Research-Lab/elite/tree/main/rhetoric/classify/prompts) that classify text for:

    1.  Policy discussion
    2.  Policy attacks
    3.  Personal Attacks
    4.  Accomplishments
    5.  Bipartisanship

## Tracker performs at least as good as trained annotators

![](images/Screenshot%202024-10-08%20at%2011.54.12%20AM.png)

::: notes
this measure compares various measures of reliability by comparing results from either chatgpt4.5 or trained coders to data we labeled ourselves for two categories and you see that chatgpt's reliability was consistently better than hand codes
:::

## [![](images/Screenshot%202024-10-08%20at%203.22.22%20PM.png)](https://americaspoliticalpulse.com/)

::: notes
we have taken this data and created this website where we release survey data fromm yougov on what we call partisan attitudes weekly as well as a dashboard that lets people look up their legislators

we created this for a couple reasons. one we were hoping to get information out there for journalists, policymakers and voters and it would be used to incentivize policymakers to be less divisive and there are different organizatios now that have started to incorporate this data into their depolarization initiatives.
:::

## ![](images/classifications.png){height="750"}

::: notes
here is the distribution of different types of attacks by the place that policymakers used them. there is clearly some sensible variaiton between sources, egg., they talk about accomplishments a ton in newsletters and statements, but not on the floor. what stands out to me is how much they talk about policy in general, either in the form of a critique or in a positive way and how little they make attacks.
:::

## ![](images/classifications_party.png){height="750"}

## ![](images/classifications_attack_time1.png){height="750"}

## 

## Summary

1.  Personal attacks are rare and policy critiques are common

2.  Some form of policy discussion makes up a plurality of elite rhetoric

3.  The prevalence of these types has gone up and down in the short term

::: notes
politics doesn't seem as divisive as we, at least according to the pew interviews, think it is. if it is omnipresent in our own media feeds it's less because of a objective view of information than a hyperfocus on negativity.

the main thing i'm hoping to do here is showcase that there is all this data that we've collected and that you might feel inspired to do something with it.
:::

## The rise and demand for identity-oriented media coverage

-   with Dan Hopkins and Sam Wolken

-   Social media content from 19 prominent media outlets' accounts

-   Include online (Politico), print (New York Times) outlets; national & regional (Philadelphia Inquirer); varying political slants (Breitbart, OANN, Fox News, Huffington Post)

-   6.2 million tweets from Twitter, 2007-2021

-   553,078 URLS from Facebook Social Science One

-   Hand-code samples (N=15k); use BERT (language model) to extend beyond human capacity

## Annotation:

-   Sample categories: RACEETHNIC: 1 if tweet makes explicit reference to a group identity based on race/ethnicity (White people, Black people, Hispanics, indigenous people etc.); 0 otherwise.
-   POLITICAL: 1 if tweet makes explicit reference to a group de ned by political/partisan identities (e.g., Democrats, Republicans, libertarians); 0 otherwise. Mentions of party (e.g. Mitch McConnell, a Republican")

## Classifier performance ![](images/clipboard-3832264735.png){height="90%"}

::: notes
we tried different classifiers, for each category. either based on data that was poooled across facebook and twitter or data that was platform specific. we then went with the classifier that gave us the most reliable results.
:::

## ![](images/prop_tweets.png){height="90%"}

::: notes
this is just the percentage of tweets in our data that were classified as having any identity present. and you see that the number has about doubled since 2007
:::

## 

![](images/f1a.png)

::: notes
here is the percent of tweets that were classified as having a racial group and you see a fairly big uptick from less than 1 percent to over 2 percent by the end of our data collection. the grey is from the bert classifier, the dotted line is from the handcoded data. we also marked what we thought were the major events that were specifically about race at that time, and you see that there is often a bump at that time, but not always.
:::

## ![](images/f1c.png)

::: notes
this is the percent of tweets that were classified as having a political identity and you see a similar pattern. political identies have clearly become far more salient in the press over the past 15 years of going from roughly 2.5 percent to about 5 percent of all tweets entionings a political group
:::

## ![](images/f1d.png)

::: notes
this is the percent of tweets that were classified as having gender and again you see a gender has become far more salient and doesn't always seem to follow a clear event-driven pattern
:::

## Summary

-   Identity-content has increased
-   Sometimes, but not always, related to events
-   The prevalence and changes don't seem to be related to outlet type (legacy/digital first) or political slant

## Why does this stuff feel like it's everywhere event though we say we don't like?

:::

## Changing incentives for content makers

1.  The job of the legislator is increasingly bad (Hall, 2019), the decline of the incumbency advantage and the rise permanent campaign means (Druckman) "newer members of Congress show up without much concern about policy and instead focus on their communications staff and getting attention on social media and cable news."

2.  Media producers are facing far more competition and there is less revenue to go around

3.  New tools allow for more fine-grained feedback, e.g., minute-by-minute ratings, A/B testing of content, likes, retweets, comments, etc. started emerging in the early 2000s.

::: notes
1.  Blunt tools, e.g., broadcaster ratings, letters to the editor, election results
2.  Demand was not driven by actual feedback but an imagined audience (Coddington et al 2021)

(Hector Sigala, Bernie Sander's 2016 social media director, quoted in Kreiss et al, 2017)`

## Media consumers are also looking for ways to cut through the noise:

1.  As we face increasing volumes of data, we increasingly rely on heuristics.
2.  Divisive content is a great heuristic for information consumption:
    1.  Is this content relevant and important to me? (Feinberg and Willer, 2012)
    2.  Is this content coming from someone I trust?

::: notes
how do i know whether to stop and read this headline? is it worth my time? is it going to convey useful information?
:::

## Everyone is an information producer now:

1.  Sharing divisive content is a great way to signal that you are trustworthy/a good team member (e.g., Ahn, Lelkes, Levendusky Study 1; Jordan and Rand, 2021, Crocket 2017 )
2.  People think sharing such content is normative (e.g. Ahn, Lelkes, Levendusky Study 2)

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 75%;"}
➔ **divisive content is useful content**
:::

::: notes
1.  Respondents shown a divisive tweet (critical of the person's worldview or party) or an anodyne tweet followed by a person criticizing the original tweet.

2.  For both the tweet and the reply, respondents were asked to evaluate the perceived partisanship, how co-partisans would view the tweet, and how they felt about the authors.

3.  People who saw an offensive tweet were more likely to perceive the author as an out-partisan, believe that other people in their party would dislike the author, and feel more negatively towards the author.

4.  Respondents were shown a divisive tweet and then asked how other people in their party would respond and how they would respond.

5.  We primed group norms by randomizing the order of the followup questions.

6.  Those shown the group norm question first were more likely to say that they would pile-on and attack the author.

# **Does divisive content sell?**

## Divisive content gets more engagement (PRL data)

![](images/clipboard-3994850730.png){width="750"}

## Identity related content was more likely to garner engagement

![](images/f6.png){width="1000"}

-   similar results using Facebook data (people were were likely to share, like and comment on identity content—but not more likely to share it)

::: notes
the paper documents evidence across platforms that this content garners more engagement--often dramatically sow. the red dotes here indicate, for each outlet, the change in likes and retweets a post classified by Bert would get, the green triangles are the coefficients from the hand annotated data. our facebook data also shows a similar pattern with one exception--this stuff was more likely to garner engagement, but less likely to be read. nonetheless, I can think of various reasons why this isn't causal. for instance, Social identity cues are more common in some news stories than others, so the evidence presented above does not rule out alternative explanations.

-   Including an identity category increased clicks by .79/1000 impressions \[CI: .59-.99\]
-   Effect size is roughly the same size as putting "Obama" (.86), "sex" (.65), or "arrest" (.87)
-   Robust to including controls such as a headline's "clickbait" score and various measures of emotionality

## Some future questions:

1.  Can we identify different types of speech that have different effects on public opinion and political behavior?
2.  Can we make externally valid causal claims about specific types of speech in the real world?

::: notes
can we move beyond negative and positive or toxic or not and identify actually polarizing language. there are classifiers out there, but some language although negative may be good for democracy

there are lots of lab studies on the effect of this type of rhetoric or that type of rhetoric on attitudes. i have done some of that work and i think it is useful, ut it is limited in what it can tell us about the real world

there are also lots of studies that look at coarse changes in the media eco system on changes in voting behavior etc etc. we are hoping that by collecting all this daily time series survey data and all this data on rhetoric we might start being able to bridge this stuff. although we don't yet have a clever identification strategy
:::

## Can we target incentives to share and create this content?

3.  How do we think about changing incentives for politicians and media producers to produce such content?
4.  How do we think about changing incentives for media consumers to consume (and share) such content?

::: notes
research is focused on these informaitonal interventions on depolarization

## Overview of the talk

::: nonincremental
1.  Is the Information Environment More Divisive?
    -   Maybe, but past approaches fall short.
    -   There is a disproportionate amount of attention given to this content
2.  Why Negativity?
    -   Politicians & media crave attention (perhaps more than ever).
    -   New tools help track attention.
    -   Information overload
    -   Divisive content cuts through the noise.
